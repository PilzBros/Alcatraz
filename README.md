# Alcatraz
Alcatraz is a unique prison role playing plugin which provides an exciting and authentic prison experience on your server. Unlike other prison plugins which are boring and repetitive, Alcatraz includes new challenges and activities for inmates to keep them busy. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Alcatraz is the countdown, inmates have a configurable amount of time in prison before they're executed. Inmates have a variety of other goals and challenges to overcome in order to survive in prison. Alcatraz provides things like combat, looting, raids, mining, lock picking and many other new prison features.
